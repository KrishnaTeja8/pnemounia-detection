# Pneumonia Detection Using EfficientNet-B0 and VGG16

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images using deep learning models. We compare the performance of two popular convolutional neural network architectures: **EfficientNet-B0** and **VGG16**. The ultimate goal is to identify the most accurate model for binary classification of pneumonia (Pneumonia vs. Normal).

After extensive training and evaluation, **EfficientNet-B0** achieved the highest accuracy, making it the preferred model for this task.

---

## 🔍 Dataset

We used the **Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)** dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia), which contains:

* **Normal** chest X-rays
* **Pneumonia** chest X-rays (including bacterial and viral pneumonia)

The dataset is split into training, validation, and test folders.

## 🧠 Models Used

### 1. **EfficientNet-B0**

* State-of-the-art architecture with optimized performance.
* Transfer learning using pretrained weights on ImageNet.
* Achieved the **highest accuracy** among the models tested.

### 2. **VGG16**

* Classic deep CNN architecture.
* Also used transfer learning.
* Solid performance, but slightly less accurate than EfficientNet-B0.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pneumonia-detection.git
cd pneumonia-detection
```

2. Prepare the dataset:

   * Download from Kaggle.
   * Place it in the `data/` directory with the folder structure: `data/train`, `data/test`, and `data/val`.

3. Train EfficientNet-B0:

```bash
python train_efficientnet.py
```

4. Train VGG16:

```bash
python train_vgg16.py
```

5. Evaluate models:

```bash
python evaluate_models.py
```

## 📈 Results

| Model           | Accuracy  | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
| --------------- | --------- | --------- | ------ | -------- |
| EfficientNet-B0 | **97.5%** | 97.8%     | 97.3%  | 97.5%    |
| VGG16           | 94.1%     | 93.9%     | 94.0%  | 94.0%    |

✅ **EfficientNet-B0 outperformed VGG16**, making it the better model for pneumonia detection in our experiments.
